    /*
     *  Abstraction -   Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relavant data
                        about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
                        *   Abstraction is just opposite of Encapsulation. Abstraction is mechanism to show only relevant data
                            to the user. Consider the same mobile example again. Whenever you buy a mobile phone, 
                            you see their different types of functionalities as camera, mp3 player, calling function, 
                            recording function, multimedia etc. It is abstraction, because you are seeing only relevant 
                            information instead of their internal engineering.
     *  Encapsulation - That binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, 
                        and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. 
                        Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.
                        *   Encapsulation is the process of hiding irrelevant data from the user. 
                            To understand encapsulation, consider an example of mobile phone. 
                            Whenever you buy a mobile, you don’t see how circuit board works. 
                            You are also not interested to know how digital signal converts into analog signal and vice versa.
                            These are the irrelevant information for the mobile user, that’s why it is encapsulated inside a cabinet.
     *  Inheritance -   They are used to depict parent child relationship.
     *  Polymorphism -  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
                        The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference 
                        is used to refer to a child class object.
     
     *  Encapsulation and abstraction is the advanced mechanism in C# that lets your program to hide unwanted code 
        within a capsule and shows only essential features of an object. 
        Encapsulation is used to hide its members from outside class or interface, 
        whereas abstraction is used to show only essential features.
     
     *  In C# programming, Encapsulation uses five types of modifier to encapsulate data. 
        These modifiers are public, private, internal, protected and protected internal. 
        These all includes different types of characteristics and makes different types of boundary of code
